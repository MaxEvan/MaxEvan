# 👋 Hi, I’m @MaxEvan (Maxime Evangeliste)
- 🇨🇦 I’m a french Canadian from Montreal who started coding in 2013.
- 🇵🇭 I lived in the Philippines for 2.5 years between 2018 and 2020 and developed a lot of skills over there.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of technology stuff, sports and music.
- 🎨 Coming from the world of frontend but...
- 📚 I’m currently wearing a backend developer hat on a couple of projects, learning more things about server side architecture and distributed systems. So I guess that makes me a full stack developer 🤔
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on mostly typescript open source projects but I'm open to learning other languages too.
- 📫 How to reach me: max.evangeliste@gmail.com
